# Summary
*Building a delimited file viewer.* 
Why?  Quickly view a delimited file (comma-delimited is the default) 
      *and* autosize columns according to content.
      
* High priority features:
  * Button/Action to "toggle"-autosize (i.e. the user has modified column widths so restore autosize but allow to restore user settings)
  * Modifications to view* should be captured in a way that both displays the mod to the user and lets them selectively enable/disable it.
     * For example, if I filter a column, the filter expression should be displayed in a way that I can later disable the filter expression
    ... but!... it should still exist in the UI in case I want to re-enable it (i.e. toggle it for the rest of the "session")
     * For example, same goes for sorting on a column
        - drag and drop reorder of sorting priority?
  * Allow SQL-like filtering (i.e. where columnN = expression); 
    - perhaps use DB driver that understands file?
    
* Medium priority features:
  * Search (see JIDE lib; example here <http://www.tutego.de/java/additional-java-swing-components.htm>)
  * Auto detect numeric and date fields
  
* Low priority features:
  * Customize colors/theme

# Misc/Notes
pattern for exposing API settings/actions:
checkbox is not inherently an "action" but its paradigm is virtually the same as a button
